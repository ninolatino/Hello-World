# Hello-World

I love animals and consider myself an animal person. I feel that they offer uncoditional love and offer the best in this world. Some of the bst domesticated animals are dogs and cats. I have one dog who gets a little nervous around unfamiliar dogs and gets territorial and barks when new dogs come around as if to announce that this is his spot and not to mess with him. He is currently being trained to remove some of this questionable behaviour that he has.
